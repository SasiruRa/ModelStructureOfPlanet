## About The Project

For read more about the project [Project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k0blSlR1mDO0ExBX5oE83_jVD22Eapk_/view?usp=sharing)

We developed this for our undergrad physics projects. There were three other research partners with me to develop this model.

## Built With

We use python for develop these scripts and with the help of few  famous libraries for mathematical development

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

python 3 should be installed in your computer and following libries should installed as well via pip.

* pip

```sh
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
```

### Installation

2. Clone the repo

```sh
https://github.com/sasirura/Eisberg
```

3. Run a script by script

```python
python Core.py
```

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/sasirura/Eisberg/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
